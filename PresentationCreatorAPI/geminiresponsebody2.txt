It involves creating mathematical representations of a company's or project's financial situation, often using spreadsheets.  \n\n**Key elements:**\n\n* **Assumptions:**  Estimates about future events, like sales growth or interest rates, form the foundation of the model.\n* **Formulas:**  Mathematical equations connect assumptions to financial outputs, such as revenue, expenses, and cash flow.\n* **Scenarios:**  Multiple sets of assumptions are used to test the sensitivity of the model's output to different conditions.\n\n**Applications:**\n\n* **Valuation:**  Estimating the value of a company or asset.\n* **Investment Analysis:**  Evaluating potential investment opportunities.\n* **Budgeting and Forecasting:**  Planning future financial operations and resource allocation.\n* **Risk Management:**  Identifying and quantifying potential risks and their impact. \n"

Monetary economics focuses on the role of money in the economy. It examines how money supply, interest rates, and inflation affect economic activity. Key areas include:

* **Money supply and banking:** The creation and control of money by central banks and commercial banks.
* **Interest rates and monetary policy:** How central banks manipulate interest rates to influence inflation, output, and employment.
* **Inflation and deflation:** The rise and fall in the general price level, and their impact on economic decision-making.
* **Exchange rates and international finance:** How monetary policy affects the value of a currency in relation to others.
* **Financial markets and institutions:** The role of financial markets in allocating capital and facilitating transactions. 

Monetary economics provides insights into how to manage economic fluctuations, promote stable prices, and foster economic growth.

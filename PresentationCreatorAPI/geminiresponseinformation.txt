## Monetary Economics:
Monetary economics studies the role of money in the economy, focusing on:
* Money supply: The total amount of money in circulation.
* Interest rates: The cost of borrowing money.
* Inflation: A general increase in prices.
* Central banking: Institutions that manage monetary policy.
Key concepts include:
* Money demand: The amount of money people want to hold.
* Money neutrality: The idea that changes in the money supply only affect nominal variables like prices, not real variables like output.
* The Phillips curve: Shows the relationship between inflation and unemployment.
* Monetary policy tools: Central banks use tools like interest rate adjustments and open market operations to influence the economy. 
Understanding monetary economics is crucial for policymakers and individuals alike, helping to navigate economic fluctuations and promote stability.
